Recipe Box App

This project is a quick and dirty React app that uses the Edamam API to serve up recipe cards. The server is built with Express and Node.

The cards include a label and an external link to the recipe. Search any ingredient and get a batch of recipes to explore!

It is hosted on Cyclic. I used some minimal React-Bootstrap elements for styling, but most of the styling is my own.
